### Hii!

I'm someone who likes to learn, understand how things work, and challenge myself.

I have some repositories; none of them are anything serious, except the ant project — it’s my personal work of engineering/art.

I learn whatever I want or need, so my tech stack isn’t really important, but I like to use C++ and Python.

I don’t really know what to put here yet, sooo for now, that’s it :)
