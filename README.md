### Hii!

I'm someone who like to learn, know how things works, and challenge myself

I have some repositories, noone is anything serious, anything but the ant-project, it's my personal work of engeniering/art

I learn all what i want or nead, so my tech-stack isn't realy important, but i like to use c++ and python :)
